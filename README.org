Standalone program that maintains a local sqlite cache of (name . email) pairs by extracting
senders and recipients from email messages in an IMAP-accessible inbox.

Provides additional emacs utility to enable completing read of email addresses by name/email within gnus message mode.

* Features
 - Not too slow: extracts only TO/FROM/CC/BCC fields. Does not fetch or store message bodies, attachments or other heavier fields.
 - Batches of emails processed in parallel
 - Fetches newest messages first. It is not necessary to process entire inbox to have usable completion
 - Not gmail specific, works with any imap server

* Building/Installation
- Clone this repository, then run ~lein uberjar~.
- Alternatively, use a standalone jar from the releases (TODO)
* Emacs Installation
 - Place ~resources/imap-contacts.el~ in your emacs load path.
 - ~(require 'imap-contacts)~
 - Alternatively, install from MELPA (TODO)
 A binding ~C-c i~ is made available in gnus message-mode for completing read of a contact. A hook to briefly refresh contacts is automatically added to gnus-summary-mode.
