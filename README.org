Standalone program that maintains a local sqlite cache of (name . email) pairs by extracting
senders and recipients from email messages in an IMAP-accessible inbox.

Provides additional emacs utility to enable completing read of email addresses by name/email within gnus message mode.

* Features
 - Not too slow: extracts only TO/FROM/CC/BCC fields. Does not fetch or store message bodies, attachments or other heavier fields.
 - Batches of emails processed in parallel
 - Fetches newst messages first. It is not necessary to process entire inbox to have usable completion
 - Not gmail specific, works with any imap server

* Building/Installation
- Clone this repository, then run ~lein uberjar~. See Bugs
- Alternatively, use a standalone jar from the releases

* Bugs
  This project depends on features of [[https://github.com/owainlewis/clojure-mail][clojure-mail]] unreleased as of this writing. A workaround is to clone the latest version from master, run ~lein install~ locally, and build this project locally. Alternatively, use the standalone jar.
